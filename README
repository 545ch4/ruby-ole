= TODO

* fix this README :)
* finish fleshing out tests - 100% coverage (currently 96%).
  - ranges io tests
  - file system api tests
  - more storage tests
* make property sets easier to use, adding in some smarts about the
  prop ids, and naming the properties in known sections.
  see ideas in other data/propids
  think the way it should work, is that the PropertySet::Section object
  should have method_missing, which looks up the guid in a name => id mapping,
  and pulls out the appropriate property id, and returns it. this is a general
  thing, and will work for all known property set section guids.
  all that remains then is some OLE document level helper magic to look in
  the sets, and provide access to the section directly.
* audit unpack strings to fix endianness issues. done?
* fix mode strings - like truncate when using 'w+', supporting append
  'a+' modes etc. done?
* make ranges io obey readable vs writeable modes.
* more RangesIO completion. ie, doesn't support #<< at the moment.
* ability to zero out padding and unused blocks
* more benchmarking, profiling, and speed fixes.
* supposedly vba does something weird to ole files. test that.
