= TODO

* fix this README :)
* finish fleshing out tests - 100% coverage (currently 96%).
  - ranges io tests
  - file system api tests
  - more storage tests
* make property sets easier to use, adding in some smarts about the
  prop ids, and naming the properties in known sections.
  see ideas in other data/propids
* audit unpack strings to fix endianness issues.
* fix mode strings - like truncate when using 'w+', supporting append
  'a+' modes etc. done?
* make ranges io obey readable vs writeable modes.
* more RangesIO completion. ie, doesn't support #<< at the moment.
* ability to zero out padding and unused blocks
* more benchmarking, profiling, and speed fixes.
* supposedly vba does something weird to ole files. test that.
