= Introduction

For now, see the docs for the Ole::Storage class.

= TODO

== 1.2.8

* fix property sets a bit more. see TODO in Ole::Storage::MetaData
* fix mode strings - like truncate when using 'w+', supporting append
  'a+' modes etc. done?
* make ranges io obey readable vs writeable modes.
* more RangesIO completion. ie, doesn't support #<< at the moment.
* ability to zero out padding and unused blocks
* case insensitive mode for ole/file_system?

== 1.3.1

* fix this README :). maybe move todo out, and put something useful here.
* finish fleshing out tests - 100% coverage (currently at 96%).
  - ranges io tests
  - file system api tests
  - more storage tests

== Longer term

* more benchmarking, profiling, and speed fixes. was thinking vs other
  ruby filesystems (eg, vs File/Dir itself, and vs rubyzip), and vs other
  ole implementations (maybe perl's, and poifs) just to check its in the
  ballpark, with no remaining silly bottlenecks.
* supposedly vba does something weird to ole files. test that.
