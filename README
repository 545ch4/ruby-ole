* finish fleshing out tests - 100% coverage (currently 95%).
  in particular - no propertyset tests yet.
  also make property sets easier to use, adding in some smarts about the
  prop ids, and naming the properties in known sections.
* audit unpack strings to fix endianness issues.
* fix mode strings - like truncate when using 'w+', supporting append
  'a+' modes etc.

* more RangesIO completion. ie, doesn't support #<< at the moment.

* ability to zero out padding and unused blocks

* more benchmarking, profiling, and speed fixes.

* supposedly vba does something weird to ole files. test that.
* properly credit all external sources.

idea for fixing mode string stuff. use mode string class to make this work:

	Ole::Storage.open('file.doc', 'rb') { |ole| ... } # standard for read
	Ole::Storage.open('file.doc', 'rb+') { |ole| ... } # standard for write
	Ole::Storage.open('file.doc', 'r') { |ole| ... } # warns due to lack of binary
	Ole::Storage.open('file.doc', 'wb') { |ole| ... } # warns due to lack of read. need to read for bat migration, even if only writing

	and further, extend it to RangesIO, such that it automatically calls truncate
	for 'w' modes, automatically seeks for 'a' modes, etc etc. as for binary, it
	will be ignored.
